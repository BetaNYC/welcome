# welcome

Purpose: Indoc for new brigade members (first hacknight). Lets put ideas and resources in the `outline.md`, and the actual learning content in index.md

Published as http://welcome.c4hrva.us using GitHub pages.

Feel free to fork for your own brigade and tweak to help new people into the Brigade. Please please, if you add to your local brigade fork and think other cities could benifit, consider sending it to us via Pull Request or even an email so everyone benifits. bret@codeforamerica.org

## How to contribue to this

 * Most of us just want to add/edit content, which are in .md files, formatted as *[markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown)*. It's easiest if you just edit the .md files in this browser window rather then the traditional way of cloning to your local machine.
 * We only care about the `gh-pages` branch, which in a github pages site like this, is the true `master` branch. You can always make a feature-branch if you have significant content to add and want to use the Pull Request process as a feedback loop before pushing to `gh-pages`.
