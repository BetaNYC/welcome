# Welcome - Intro for new Bridgade members for {{page.brigade}}
A Code for America Volunteer Brigade

Glad you could make it to our hacknight. This page is full of information and links for the Brigade beginner. We hope you like it and return to the next hacknight.

## Purpose and Foundation

Code for America aims to improve the relationships between citizens and government. We help governments restructure to create low-risk settings for innovation, engage citizens to create better services, and support ongoing competition in the govtech marketplace.
 
* We brainstorm and implement ways to use public data to build apps that help solve city problems and foster open government.

* We sponsor activities including hackathons, write-a-thons, unconferences, open data activities, and meetups.
 
* We are __Civic Hackers__... and what is Civic Hacking?
   
  * Hacking is about finding new ways to get stuff done, often through constraints and limited resources. Itâ€™s also about finding new uses for old designs.
    
  * Civic hacking is about coders, designers and other technologists using their skills to make positive contributions to their neighborhoods, communities, and cities.
   
  * Civic hacking is part of what we do at Code for America.


Some notable brigade achievements this last year and the momentum continues.
 
* Connected 1800 people, growing at about 25 per week, to a national network of, by, and for civic tech volunteers
 
* Twenty cities began meeting regularly, at least once per month, but most meet weekly
 
* At least 45 open source, civic tech apps were redeployed
 
* Thousands of datasets were made more accessible online
 
* Scores of representatives from dozens of municipal governments opened up to our community and created with us a new form of civic engagement
